    Format numeric values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vals : Union[Any, List[Any]]
        A list of values to be formatted.
    decimals : int
        The `decimals` values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such
        as `2.34` can, for example, be formatted with `0` decimal places and it would result in
        `"2"`. With `4` decimal places, the formatted value becomes `"2.3400"`. The trailing zeros
        can be removed with `drop_trailing_zeros=True`. If you always need `decimals = 0`, the
        `fmt_integer()` method should be considered.
    n_sigfig : Optional[int]
        A option to format numbers to *n* significant figures. By default, this is `None` and thus
        number values will be formatted according to the number of decimal places set via
        `decimals`. If opting to format according to the rules of significant figures, `n_sigfig`
        must be a number greater than or equal to `1`. Any values passed to the `decimals` and
        `drop_trailing_zeros` arguments will be ignored.
    drop_trailing_zeros : bool
        A boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the
        decimal mark).
    drop_trailing_dec_mark : bool
        A boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are
        no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., `23` becomes `23.` if `False`). By
        default trailing decimal marks are not shown.
    use_seps : bool
        The `use_seps` option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group
        separator is set by `sep_mark` and overridden if a locale ID is provided to `locale`. This
        setting is `True` by default.
    scale_by : float
        All numeric values will be multiplied by the `scale_by` value before undergoing formatting.
        Since the `default` value is `1`, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier
        value is supplied.
    pattern : str
        A formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value
        is represented by the `{x}` (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other
        characters will be interpreted as string literals.
    sep_mark : str
        The string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using `sep_mark=","`
        with a value of `1000` would result in a formatted value of `"1,000"`. This argument is
        ignored if a `locale` is supplied (i.e., is not `None`).
    dec_mark : str
        The string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using `dec_mark=","` with the value
        `0.152` would result in a formatted value of `"0,152"`). This argument is ignored if a
        `locale` is supplied (i.e., is not `None`).
    force_sign : bool
        Should the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all
        values except zero)? If so, use `True` for this option. The default is `False`, where only
        negative numbers will display a minus sign. This option is disregarded when using accounting
        notation with `accounting = True`.
    locale : str
        An optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale's
        rules. Examples include `"en"` for English (United States) and `"fr"` for French (France).

    Returns
    -------
    List[str]
        A list of formatted values is returned.

    Format values to scientific notation.

    With numeric values in a list, we can perform formatting so that the input values are rendered
    in scientific notation, where extremely large or very small numbers can be expressed in a more
    practical fashion. Here, numbers are written in the form of a mantissa (`m`) and an exponent
    (`n`) with the construction *m* x 10^*n* or *m*E*n*. The mantissa component is a number between
    `1` and `10`. For instance, `2.5 x 10^9` can be used to represent the value 2,500,000,000 in
    scientific notation. In a similar way, 0.00000012 can be expressed as `1.2 x 10^-7`. Due to its
    ability to describe numbers more succinctly and its ease of calculation, scientific notation is
    widely employed in scientific and technical domains.

    We have fine control over the formatting task, with the following options:

    - decimals: choice of the number of decimal places, option to drop trailing zeros, and a choice
    of the decimal symbol
    - scaling: we can choose to scale targeted values by a multiplier value
    - pattern: option to use a text pattern for decoration of the formatted values

    chosen locale

    Parameters
    ----------
    vals : Union[Any, List[Any]]
        A list of values to be formatted.
    decimals : int
        The `decimals` values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such
        as `2.34` can, for example, be formatted with `0` decimal places and it would result in
        `"2"`. With `4` decimal places, the formatted value becomes `"2.3400"`. The trailing zeros
        can be removed with `drop_trailing_zeros=True`. If you always need `decimals = 0`, the
        `fmt_integer()` method should be considered.
    n_sigfig : Optional[int]
        A option to format numbers to *n* significant figures. By default, this is `None` and thus
        number values will be formatted according to the number of decimal places set via
        `decimals`. If opting to format according to the rules of significant figures, `n_sigfig`
        must be a number greater than or equal to `1`. Any values passed to the `decimals` and
        `drop_trailing_zeros` arguments will be ignored.
    drop_trailing_zeros : bool
        A boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the
        decimal mark).
    drop_trailing_dec_mark : bool
        A boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are
        no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., `23` becomes `23.` if `False`). By
        default trailing decimal marks are not shown.
    scale_by : float
        All numeric values will be multiplied by the `scale_by` value before undergoing formatting.
        Since the `default` value is `1`, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier
        value is supplied.
    exp_style : str
        Style of formatting to use for the scientific notation formatting. By default this is
        `"x10n"` but other options include using a single letter (e.g., `"e"`, `"E"`, etc.), a
        letter followed by a `"1"` to signal a minimum digit width of one, or `"low-ten"` for using
        a stylized `"10"` marker.
    pattern : str
        A formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value
        is represented by the `{x}` (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other
        characters will be interpreted as string literals.
    sep_mark : str
        The string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using `sep_mark=","`
        with a value of `1000` would result in a formatted value of `"1,000"`. This argument is
        ignored if a `locale` is supplied (i.e., is not `None`).
    dec_mark : str
        The string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using `dec_mark=","` with the value
        `0.152` would result in a formatted value of `"0,152"`). This argument is ignored if a
        `locale` is supplied (i.e., is not `None`).
    force_sign_m : bool
        Should the plus sign be shown for positive values of the mantissa (first component)? This
        would effectively show a sign for all values except zero on the first numeric component of
        the notation. If so, use `True` (the default for this is `False`), where only negative
        numbers will display a sign.
    force_sign_n : bool
        Should the plus sign be shown for positive values of the exponent (second component)? This
        would effectively show a sign for all values except zero on the second numeric component of
        the notation. If so, use `True` (the default for this is `False`), where only negative
        numbers will display a sign.
    locale : str
        An optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale's
        rules. Examples include `"en"` for English (United States) and `"fr"` for French (France).

    Parameters
    ----------
    vals : Union[Any, List[Any]]
        A list of values to be formatted.
    decimals : int
        The `decimals` values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. A value such

    drop_trailing_zeros : bool
        A boolean value that allows for removal of trailing zeros (those redundant zeros after the

    drop_trailing_dec_mark : bool
        A boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are
        no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., `23` becomes `23.` if `False`). By
        default trailing decimal marks are not shown.
    scale_values : bool
        Should the values be scaled through multiplication by 100? By default this scaling is
        performed since the expectation is that incoming values are usually proportional. Setting to
        `False` signifies that the values are already scaled and require only the percent sign when
        formatted.
    use_seps : bool
        The `use_seps` option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group
        separator is set by `sep_mark` and overridden if a locale ID is provided to `locale`. This
        setting is `True` by default.
    pattern : str
        A formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value
        is represented by the `{x}` (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other
        characters will be interpreted as string literals.
    sep_mark : str
        The string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using `sep_mark=","`
        with a value of `1000` would result in a formatted value of `"1,000"`. This argument is
        ignored if a `locale` is supplied (i.e., is not `None`).
    dec_mark : str
        The string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using `dec_mark=","` with the value
        `0.152` would result in a formatted value of `"0,152"`). This argument is ignored if a
        `locale` is supplied (i.e., is not `None`).
    force_sign : bool
        Should the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all
        values except zero)? If so, use `True` for this option. The default is `False`, where only
        negative numbers will display a minus sign. This option is disregarded when using accounting
        notation with `accounting = True`.
    placement : str
        This option governs the placement of the percent sign. This can be either be `"right"` (the
        default) or `"left"`.
    incl_space : bool
        An option for whether to include a space between the value and the percent sign. The default
        is to not introduce a space character.
    locale : str

        Removing the subunits (with `use_subunits = False`) will give us `"$273"`.
    decimals : int
        The `decimals` values corresponds to the exact number of decimal places to use. This value
        is optional as a currency has an intrinsic number of decimal places (i.e., the subunits).
        A value such as `2.34` can, for example, be formatted with `0` decimal places and if the
        currency used is `"USD"` it would result in `"$2"`. With `4` decimal places, the formatted
        value becomes `"$2.3400"`.
    drop_trailing_dec_mark : bool
        A boolean value that determines whether decimal marks should always appear even if there are
        no decimal digits to display after formatting (e.g., `23` becomes `23.` if `False`). By
        default trailing decimal marks are not shown.
    use_seps : bool
        The `use_seps` option allows for the use of digit group separators. The type of digit group
        separator is set by `sep_mark` and overridden if a locale ID is provided to `locale`. This
        setting is `True` by default.
    scale_by : float
        All numeric values will be multiplied by the `scale_by` value before undergoing formatting.
        Since the `default` value is `1`, no values will be changed unless a different multiplier
        value is supplied.
    pattern : str
        A formatting pattern that allows for decoration of the formatted value. The formatted value
        is represented by the `{x}` (which can be used multiple times, if needed) and all other
        characters will be interpreted as string literals.
    sep_mark : str
        The string to use as a separator between groups of digits. For example, using `sep_mark=","`
        with a value of `1000` would result in a formatted value of `"1,000"`. This argument is
        ignored if a `locale` is supplied (i.e., is not `None`).
    dec_mark : str
        The string to be used as the decimal mark. For example, using `dec_mark=","` with the value
        `0.152` would result in a formatted value of `"0,152"`). This argument is ignored if a
        `locale` is supplied (i.e., is not `None`).
    force_sign : bool
        Should the positive sign be shown for positive values (effectively showing a sign for all
        values except zero)? If so, use `True` for this option. The default is `False`, where only
        negative numbers will display a minus sign. This option is disregarded when using accounting
        notation with `accounting = True`.
    placement : str
        The placement of the currency symbol. This can be either be `"left"` (as in `"$450"`) or
        `"right"` (which yields `"450$"`).
    incl_space : bool
        An option for whether to include a space between the value and the currency symbol. The
        default is to not introduce a space character.
    locale : str
        An optional locale identifier that can be used for formatting values according the locale's
        rules. Examples include `"en"` for English (United States) and `"fr"` for French (France).
