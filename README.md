With **great_tables** anyone can make wonderful-looking tables in Python. The **gt** philosophy is that we can construct a wide variety of useful tables by working with a cohesive set of table parts. You can mix and match things like a *header* and *footer*, attach a *stub* (which contains row labels), arrange *spanner labels* over top of the *column labels*, and much more.
